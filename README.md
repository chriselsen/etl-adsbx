## Deployment

Deployment into the CloudTAK environment for ETL tasks is done via automatic releases to the CAL-OES AWS environment.

Github actions will build and push docker releases on every version tag which can then be automatically configured via the
CloudTAK API.

### GitHub Actions Setup

The workflow uses GitHub variables and secrets to make it reusable across different ETL repositories.

#### Organization Variables (recommended)
- `DEMO_STACK_NAME`: Name of the demo stack (default: "Demo")
- `PROD_STACK_NAME`: Name of the production stack (default: "Prod")

#### Organization Secrets (recommended)
- `DEMO_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS account ID for demo environment
- `DEMO_AWS_REGION`: AWS region for demo environment
- `DEMO_AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role ARN for demo environment
- `PROD_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS account ID for production environment
- `PROD_AWS_REGION`: AWS region for production environment
- `PROD_AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role ARN for production environment

#### Repository Variables
- `ETL_NAME`: Name of the ETL (default: repository name)

#### Repository Secrets (alternative to organization secrets)
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS account ID for the environment
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for the environment
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role ARN for the environment

These variables and secrets can be set in the GitHub organization or repository settings under Settings > Secrets and variables.

### Manual Deployment

For manual deployment you can use the `scripts/etl/deploy-etl.sh` script from the [CloudTAK](https://github.com/TAK-NZ/CloudTAK/) repo.
As an example: 
```
../CloudTAK/scripts/etl/deploy-etl.sh Demo v1.0.0 --profile tak-demo
```

### CloudTAK Configuration

When registering this ETL as a task in CloudTAK:

- Use the `<repo-name>.png` file in the main folder of this repository as the Task Logo
- Use the raw GitHub URL of this README.md file as the Task Markdown Readme URL

This will ensure proper visual identification and documentation for the task in the CloudTAK interface.

## Development

CAL-OES provided Lambda ETLs are currently all written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) through the use of a AWS Lambda optimized
Docker container. Documentation for the Dockerfile can be found in the [AWS Help Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html)

```sh
npm install
```

Add a .env file in the root directory that gives the ETL script the necessary variables to communicate with a local ETL server.
When the ETL is deployed the `ETL_API` and `ETL_LAYER` variables will be provided by the Lambda Environment

```json
{
    "ETL_API": "http://localhost:5001",
    "ETL_LAYER": "19"
}
```

To run the task, ensure the local [CloudTAK](https://github.com/TAK-NZ/CloudTAK/) server is running and then run with typescript runtime
or build to JS and run natively with node

```
ts-node task.ts
```

```
npm run build
cp .env dist/
node dist/task.js
```
